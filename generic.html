								<h3>Who I Am</h3>
								<p>Born and raised in Phoenix, Arizona, I have lived my whole life surrounded by the technology and digital sphere that came about with the rise of the Information Age. I have always been interested in computers and the immense potential that can be accomplished with them, and this interest eventually led me to discover programming and creating my own applications. More recently, I have been led to pursue the radically advancing industry of artificial intelligence and its systems, which has unlocked even more possibilites for me that I wish to strive towards in my future.</p>

								<p>Currently pursuing an undergraduate degree in Computer Science at Arizona State University, I have undertaken several projects in my student career that have broadened my horizons and furthered my knowledge and abilities as a software engineer. My ambitions will lead me to always keep learning and improving upon myself, even if not every program I create goes according to my expectations. I have never been one to let failure get the best of me, and the only way to better myself is to use that valuable experience I gain from failing to build my own path to success, one small step at a time.</p>

								<hr />

								<h4>Plans for the Future</h4>
								<p>My ultimate goal is to one day work at a Fortune 500 company and contribute to some of the many applications and products that impact hundreds of millions of people every day. I believe in making a difference in the world, no matter how small or significant it may be. From creating a small-scale piece of software that influences people in the real world, to engaging with AI algorithms and machine learning that change the future of the online world, I will ensure that my work leaves an impression on the projects that I am a part of.</p>

								<p>To that end, my goals for the immediate future are to graduate with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and achieve a meaningful internship at a tech company. I also aspire to obtain a Master's degree to further my knowledge of Software Engineering and Computer Applications, which will allow me to get one step closer to my end goal. For the next few years, I will focus on building up my skillset and learning as much as I can about the Technology industry, so that I may work my way towards making my dream a reality. I am thankful for all the experience that I have accumulated in the past, and I will always be seeking more opportunities in the future, regardless of how significant they are in terms of my goals, because no great task is accomplished without the guidance of smaller ones.</p>
